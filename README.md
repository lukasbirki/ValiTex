This checklist accompanies the ValiTex framework for validating text-based measures of social science constructs by Birkenmaier et al. (2023 forthcoming). The framework provides clear guidelines for best practices in validation, with a normative stance on what constitutes good validation evidence.

User Instructions
This application generates an adaptable checklist that you can use to validate your text-based measures. Each row within the table corresponds to one validation step (i.e., a single reported and clearly demarcated validation activity). Validation steps can be either mandatory or optional depending on their relevance:

- Dictionary: Rule-based methods that include words or phrases along with their respective meanings or sentiments (e.g., SentiWS)
- Supervised: Machine-learning methods that include some form of training data and test set and/or classification task (e.g., SVM, BERT)
- Unsupervised (Topic Model): Unsupervised methods that generate topis based on word-coocurrences (e.g., LDA)
- Unsupervised (Text Scaling) Unsupervised methods that produce scores that relate to some underlying scale based on word-coocurrences (e.g., Wordfish, Wordscores)
Please start by choosing a method from the drop-down menue below. The complete list of validation steps is also available on Github
